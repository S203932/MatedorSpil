To start playing Matador, press the "Run" button in the "Game" file. 
Once the user interface has launched and the board is displayed, the user can input the number of players participating. 
The number of players must be between 2 and 6, with 2 players activating a bot player as player 2. 
Each player starts with 30000 money in their account and will gain an additional 4000 money automatically when passing "Start" again.

When starting the game, players have two options: to roll the dice or to forfeit. 
After rolling the dice, players move according to the number of eyes on the dice, and actions occur depending on the field they land on.

If a player lands on a Real Estate field, they have the option to buy the property if it is available or pass. 
If the property is already owned, the player will have to pay a specific rent to the owner. 
Owning all properties of the same color will unlock the option to upgrade the properties by building houses. 
Each house will increase the rent price, and once four houses have been built, a hotel can be constructed as the final upgrade.

Each property, house, and hotel can be mortgaged, which will return some value to the owner but the owner will not receive rent from players landing on it until the mortgage has been paid back. 
These actions can only be taken at the end of the player's turn before passing the turn to the next player. Other fields that can be acquired include the Ferry and the Breweries. 
To see the property's purchase value and subsequent upgrades, click on a property, ferry, or brewery on the middle square of the board.

If a player lands on the "Prøv Lykken" fields, they will receive a random card from a deck of 45, which has a varied array of outcomes. 
The card will be displayed in the marked square in the middle of the board.

The "Gå i Fængsel" field locks the player up until the next turn and deducts 1000 money from the player. 
An alternate means of exiting jail is if the player has the "Chance" card: "Get out of jail free." 
When exiting jail, the player starts from "På besøg," which is otherwise a neutral field when landing on it. 
Another neutral field is the "Parkering" field.

Lastly, there are the tax fields, where one force the player to pay a locked amount, 
while the other gives the player the option to either pay 2000 money or 10 percent of all their acquired values.
